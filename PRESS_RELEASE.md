# Hacked Resources
## Find and contribute to useful resources for Hack Reactor's Software Engineering Immersive (SEI)

## Summary
- Flexible, simple, quick (KISS-UX).
- List, search, sort, filter, add, modify, and delete information about useful resources for full stack programming. 
- Columns (sortable, filterable): ID, Topic, Abbreviation, Link, Level, Contributor, Description.

## Problem
- It is difficult, time consuming, and frustrating for each student to search for and find useful full stack resources.

## Solution
This app, is stable, and easy and quick to use, for both finding resources and for contributing resources. 

"When I was a student, I asked about a listing of useful resources for full stack programming. The Team Mentor compiled such a list. I asked about making the listing more structured, robust, and extendible. In the manner of the squeeky wheel, I volunteered to be the can of oil. *- Neil Bernstein BLD08*

"Already with initial release, HACKED RESOURCES is more accessible, and easier and quicker to use. I look forward to future enhancements." *- Student, BLD09*
